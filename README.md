# Info In, Book Out - Used Book Selling Web App
## [Live Site](https://info340a-w20.github.io/project-iinbo/)
You can access the live site of our application by visiting https://info340a-w20.github.io/project-iinbo/

## Tools and Framework Used
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). We use Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to enable log in feature and store user information. We also utilized the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) in our web application.

## Goal
The overarching goal of our application is to help people to find the cheapest book they want to buy quickly. We hope that the sellers are able to quickly post a book that they want to sell through our customized search feature and buyers are able to quickly contact the sellers.

## API
We used [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/reference/bookshelves) to fetch book related information.

## Basic Usage
You can click the category to view books with that specific category. You can search for any book in the search box at the search page. 

You can also make new post by first searching your book's name and author through the form. Then the search result will show up and you can select the "SELL ONE LIKE THIS" button to enter your customized description and address. Your post will then automatically be posted to the page. You can also delete a post you previously posted from that page.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
